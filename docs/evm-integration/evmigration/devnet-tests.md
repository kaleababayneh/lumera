# Devnet EVM Migration Tests

## Overview

The `tests_evmigration` tool is a standalone binary for end-to-end testing of the `x/evmigration` module on the Lumera devnet. It validates the chain's ability to atomically migrate account state when upgrading from legacy Cosmos key derivation (coin-type 118, `secp256k1`) to EVM-compatible key derivation (coin-type 60, `eth_secp256k1`).

When Lumera upgrades to support EVM (v1.20.0), the same mnemonic produces a **different on-chain address** under coin-type 60. The evmigration module provides `MsgClaimLegacyAccount` and `MsgMigrateValidator` transactions that atomically transfer all state from the old address to the new one. This tool creates realistic pre-migration state, then exercises and verifies those migration paths.

## Modules Tested

The migration touches many modules. The test tool verifies correct re-keying across all of them:

| Module                   | What's Migrated                                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **x/auth**         | Account removal + re-creation (preserves vesting params)                                              |
| **x/bank**         | Balance transfer from legacy to new address via `SendCoins`                                         |
| **x/staking**      | Delegations, unbonding entries, redelegations (with queue and `UnbondingId` indexes)                |
| **x/distribution** | Reward withdrawal, delegator starting info                                                            |
| **x/authz**        | Grant re-keying (both grantor and grantee roles)                                                      |
| **x/feegrant**     | Fee allowance re-creation (both granter and grantee)                                                  |
| **x/supernode**    | `ValidatorAddress`, `SupernodeAccount`, `Evidence`, `PrevSupernodeAccounts`, `MetricsState` |
| **x/action**       | `Creator` and `SuperNodes` fields in action records                                               |
| **x/claim**        | `DestAddress` in claim records                                                                      |
| **x/evmigration**  | Core migration logic, dual-signature verification, rate limiting, params                              |

Two custom ante decorators support the migration:

- **EVMigrationFeeDecorator** (`ante/evmigration_fee_decorator.go`) — allows zero-fee migration transactions (the new address has no balance before migration completes).
- **EVMigrationValidateBasicDecorator** (`ante/evmigration_validate_basic_decorator.go`) — lets migration-only transactions skip the normal Cosmos signature check (auth is via the legacy signature in the message payload).

## Modes

The tool has six operating modes, designed to be run sequentially during a devnet upgrade cycle.

### 1. `prepare` — Create Legacy State (Pre-EVM)

Run **before** the EVM upgrade (on v1.11.1) to populate the chain with legacy accounts and on-chain activity.

Creates **N legacy accounts** (coin-type 118, marked `IsLegacy=true` with full mnemonic stored) and **N extra accounts** for background noise. Default: 5 + 5.

Activity generated per account (deterministic pattern based on account index):

| Activity                           | Which Accounts                       | Amount / Details                                                         |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Delegations**              | Every account                        | 100k–500k ulume                                                         |
| **Unbonding**                | Every 4th legacy account             | 20k ulume                                                                |
| **Redelegations**            | Every 6th legacy account             | 1–3 entries of 15k ulume each                                           |
| **Withdraw address**         | Every 7th legacy account             | Set to a third-party address                                             |
| **Authz grants**             | Every 3rd legacy account             | Grants to 3 random peers                                                 |
| **Authz received**           | Every 4th legacy (offset 1)          | Receives grants from 3 random peers                                      |
| **Feegrants**                | Every 5th legacy account             | 500k spend-limit to 3 peers                                              |
| **Feegrants received**       | Every 6th legacy (offset 1)          | Receives feegrants from 3 peers                                          |
| **Actions (CASCADE)**        | Every 4th legacy (offset 2)          | Submitted via `sdk-go` with supernode involvement                      |
| **Claims**                   | Progressive distribution             | Pre-seeded Pastel keys; ~70% instant, ~30% delayed (tiers 1/2/3)         |
| **Withdraw chain**           | Every 9th legacy (Phase 2)           | A→B→C legacy-to-legacy withdraw address chain                          |
| **Authz+feegrant overlap**   | Every 9th legacy (offset 1, Phase 2) | Same pair gets both authz AND feegrant                                   |
| **Redelegation+withdraw**    | Every 9th legacy (offset 8, Phase 1) | Redelegation + third-party withdraw on same account                      |
| **All-validator delegation** | Every 9th legacy (offset 4, Phase 1) | Delegate to every validator for max MigrateValidatorDelegations coverage |

Execution strategy:

- **Phase 1** — Own-account operations (delegations, unbonding, redelegations, withdrawal addr, authz grants out, feegrants out) are**parallelized** in 5-worker batches.
- **Phase 2** — Cross-account operations (authz receives, feegrant receives) run**sequentially** to avoid nonce conflicts.
- **Phase 3** — Extra-account random activity, parallelized.
- **Phase 4** — Claim activity using 100 pre-seeded Pastel keypairs from`claim_keys.go`.

Output: `accounts.json` file containing the complete `AccountRecord` for each account (name, mnemonic, address, activity flags and details). This file is consumed by all subsequent modes.

### 2. `estimate` — Query Migration Readiness (Post-EVM)

Run **after** the EVM upgrade (on v1.20.0). Queries the `migration-estimate` RPC endpoint for every legacy account.

Returns per account:

- `WouldSucceed` — whether migration can proceed
- `RejectionReason` — why blocked (e.g. "already migrated", "migration disabled")
- Counts of: delegations, unbondings, redelegations, authz grants, feegrants, actions, validator delegations

Classifies each account as:

- **ready_to_migrate** —`WouldSucceed=true`
- **already_migrated** — rejection says "already migrated"
- **blocked** —`WouldSucceed=false`, logs reason

Prints a summary:

```
legacy_accounts: 5
estimates_fetched: 5
ready_to_migrate: 5
already_migrated: 0
blocked: 0
estimate_query_errors: 0
```

### 3. `migrate` — Migrate Regular Accounts (Post-EVM)

Migrates all legacy accounts using `MsgClaimLegacyAccount`. Per-account flow:

1. Check for rerun: query`migration-record` — if it already exists, skip to validation.
2. Query`migration-estimate` — verify`WouldSucceed=true`.
3. Derive the new EVM-compatible address from the same mnemonic using coin-type 60.
4. Create a new keyring entry for the destination address.
5. Sign the migration payload on both sides: legacy Cosmos sub-key signs `SHA256(payload)`; new eth sub-key signs `Keccak256(payload)`.
6. Submit `MsgClaimLegacyAccount(new_address, legacy_address, legacy_proof, new_proof)` — each proof is a `MigrationProof` oneof (single-key here, multisig when the legacy account is multisig). Migration messages declare zero signers; fees are waived by the EVMigrationFeeDecorator.
7. Verify on-chain`migration-record` exists with the correct new address.

Execution strategy:

- Accounts are shuffled randomly.
- Processed in random batches of 1–5 accounts.
- Progress saved to`accounts.json` after each batch.
- Migration stats queried after each batch.

The migration is **atomic** — a single transaction migrates the entire account state across all modules. If any step fails, the whole transaction rolls back and no record is stored.

### 4. `migrate-validator` — Migrate Validator Operator (Post-EVM)

Specialized mode for validator operators. Uses `MsgMigrateValidator` instead of `MsgClaimLegacyAccount`.

**Detection:** Iterates the local keyring, identifies keys matching active validators via staking queries, and filters for legacy `secp256k1` keys. Must match exactly one candidate (override with `-validator-keys=<name>`).

Steps:

1. Create a unique destination key (`eth_secp256k1`, coin-type 60).
2. Export the legacy validator private key.
3. Sign a validator migration proof:`sign("validator", legacy_addr, new_addr)` — note the different message prefix vs regular migration.
4. Submit`MsgMigrateValidator(new_address, legacy_address, pubkey, signature)`.
5. Verify`migration-record`.

Extensive post-migration validation:

- Estimate query post-migration must return "already migrated".
- New validator exists at the new valoper address.
- Delegator count matches pre/post migration.
- All actions referencing the old creator/supernode now reference the new address.
- Supernode fields verified:`ValidatorAddress`,`SupernodeAccount`,`Evidence` entries,`PrevSupernodeAccounts` history (new entry appended with current block height),`MetricsState` re-keyed.
- If the validator's supernode account was already migrated independently before validator migration, it must be preserved and reattached under the new valoper without tripping the stale supernode-account index collision.

### 5. `migrate-all` — Interleaved Account + Validator Migration (Post-EVM)

Combines `migrate` and `migrate-validator` into a single mode where regular accounts and the local validator candidate are shuffled into one random queue and processed in mixed batches.

**Why:** The separate `migrate-validator` → `migrate` ordering is artificial. Real-world migrations will have validators and accounts completing in unpredictable order. `migrate-all` catches ordering-dependent bugs such as:

- Accounts delegated to validators that migrate**later** (`MigrateValidatorDelegations` must re-key the already-migrated delegator's records).
- Validators whose delegators already migrated (delegation records have the new delegator address but old validator address).
- Cross-account withdraw addresses where the referenced account migrates in a different batch.

**Behavior:**

1. Collects all unmigrated legacy accounts + the local validator candidate into a unified queue.
2. Shuffles the queue randomly.
3. Processes in random batches of 1–5 items.
4. For each item: calls`migrateOne()` (accounts) or`migrateOneValidator()` (validators) — the same functions used by the standalone modes.
5. Saves progress after each batch.

This is the default mode used by `make devnet-evm-upgrade`.

### 6. `verify` — Verify No Leftover Legacy State (Post-Migration)

Run **after** all migrations complete. Queries every chain module (except `x/evmigration` itself) via RPC to confirm that no legacy address references remain in on-chain state.

For each migrated legacy address, the tool checks:

| Module                 | Check                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **bank**         | No remaining balance on legacy address                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **staking**      | No delegations, unbonding delegations, or redelegations                                                                                                                                                  |
| **distribution** | No pending rewards; withdraw address not pointing to legacy                                                                                                                                              |
| **authz**        | No grants as granter or grantee                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **feegrant**     | No allowances as granter or grantee                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **action**       | No actions referencing legacy as creator or supernode                                                                                                                                                    |
| **claim**        | No unclaimed records;`dest_address` not pointing to legacy                                                                                                                                             |
| **supernode**    | No `supernode_account` or `evidence.reporter_address` fields referencing legacy (note: `prev_supernode_accounts` entries are excluded — legacy addresses there are legitimate historical records) |
| **evmigration**  | Migration record must exist; estimate must return "already migrated"                                                                                                                                     |

Results are reported as either `PASS` (all addresses clean) or `FAIL` with per-address details grouped by module. The tool exits with a non-zero status on failure, which halts the pipeline.

### 7. `cleanup` — Remove Test Keys

Loads `accounts.json` and deletes all test keys from the local keyring (`~/.lumera/keyring-test/` or the path from `-home`).

## Makefile Targets

All targets are defined in `Makefile.devnet` and run the tool inside devnet Docker containers via `docker compose exec`.

### Sequential targets

These run the tool on each validator container **one at a time**, in order:

| Target                                        | Description                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `make devnet-evmigration-sync-bin`          | Copy the `tests_evmigration` binary into the devnet shared volume |
| `make devnet-evmigration-prepare`           | Run prepare mode on all validator containers                        |
| `make devnet-evmigration-estimate`          | Run estimate mode on all validator containers                       |
| `make devnet-evmigration-migrate`           | Run migrate mode on all validator containers                        |

### Parallel targets (`devnet-evmigrationp-*`)

These run the tool on **all validator containers simultaneously** using background processes, with per-container output captured and printed after completion. Each container gets its own accounts file, so there are no cross-validator conflicts. If any container fails, the target fails after all containers finish.

| Target                                         | Description                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `make devnet-evmigrationp-prepare`           | Run prepare mode on all validators in parallel           |
| `make devnet-evmigrationp-estimate`          | Run estimate mode on all validators in parallel          |
| `make devnet-evmigrationp-migrate`           | Run migrate mode on all validators in parallel           |
| `make devnet-evmigrationp-migrate-validator` | Run migrate-validator mode on all validators in parallel |
| `make devnet-evmigrationp-verify`            | Run verify mode on all validators in parallel            |
| `make devnet-evmigrationp-cleanup`           | Run cleanup mode on all validators in parallel           |

The parallel targets use the `_run_evmigration_in_containers_parallel` macro, which spawns one `docker compose exec` per validator service as a background process, collects exit codes, and prints output prefixed by service name. This is significantly faster for modes like `prepare` and `migrate` where each validator's work is independent.

### Full upgrade pipeline (`devnet-evm-upgrade`)

The `make devnet-evm-upgrade` target runs the **complete end-to-end EVM upgrade cycle** as a single automated pipeline. It orchestrates all stages from a clean v1.11.0 devnet through to a fully migrated v1.20.0 chain, using the parallel targets for speed:

| Stage                     | What it does                                                                            |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Install v1.11.1 devnet | `devnet-down` → `devnet-clean` → `devnet-build-1111` → `devnet-up-detach`    |
| 2. Wait for height 40     | Waits for the chain to produce blocks (confirms v1.11.1 is healthy)                     |
| 3. Prepare legacy state   | `devnet-evmigrationp-prepare` (parallel across all validators)                        |
| 4. Wait for +5 blocks     | Lets prepared state settle into committed blocks                                        |
| 5. Upgrade to v1.20.0     | `devnet-upgrade-1200` (governance proposal → vote → halt → binary swap → restart) |
| 6. Check estimates        | `devnet-evmigrationp-estimate` (verify all accounts are `ready_to_migrate`)         |
| 7. Migrate validators     | `devnet-evmigrationp-migrate-validator` (validator operators first)                   |
| 8. Migrate accounts       | `devnet-evmigrationp-migrate` (regular accounts second)                               |
| 9. Verify clean state     | `devnet-evmigrationp-verify` (confirms no legacy address leftovers in any module)     |

Each stage has error handling — if any stage fails, the pipeline aborts with a clear error message identifying which stage failed. Validators are migrated before regular accounts because `MsgMigrateValidator` atomically re-keys the validator record and all its delegations, which must happen before delegators attempt their own migration.

For release qualification, prefer this upgrade pipeline over fresh EVM devnet init. The upgrade path keeps the legacy `app.toml` on disk until `lumerad start` runs the config migration, so it exercises production-like startup behavior including `[evm.mempool]` section creation and legacy `mempool.max-txs = -1` repair.

Usage:

```bash
# Run the full upgrade pipeline (takes ~10-15 minutes)
make devnet-evm-upgrade
```

### Configurable variables

| Variable                     | Default             | Description                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `EVMIGRATION_CHAIN_ID`     | `lumera-devnet-1` | Chain ID passed to the tool             |
| `EVMIGRATION_NUM_ACCOUNTS` | `5`               | Number of legacy accounts per validator |
| `EVMIGRATION_NUM_EXTRA`    | `5`               | Number of extra accounts per validator  |

Each validator gets its own accounts file (`/shared/status/<moniker>/evmigration-accounts.json`) to avoid cross-validator key/account collisions. Account name tags are auto-derived from the local validator/funder key name.

## Building the Test Binary

```bash
make devnet-tests-build
```

This builds `tests_evmigration` (along with `tests_validator` and `tests_hermes`) and places it in `devnet/bin/`.

## Full Upgrade Test Walkthrough

> **Quick path:** `make devnet-evm-upgrade` runs all steps below automatically as a single pipeline. See [Full upgrade pipeline](#full-upgrade-pipeline-devnet-evm-upgrade) above. The manual steps below are useful for debugging or running individual stages.

### Step 1: Start devnet on v1.11.1

The `devnet/bin-v1.11.1/` directory must contain the pre-EVM binaries:

| File                      | Description                                                          |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lumerad`               | v1.11.1 chain binary                                                 |
| `libwasmvm.x86_64.so`   | CosmWasm runtime library                                             |
| `supernode-linux-amd64` | Supernode binary                                                     |
| `tests_validator`       | Validator devnet tests                                               |
| `tests_hermes`          | Hermes IBC relayer tests                                             |
| `tests_evmigration`     | EVM migration test binary (built from `devnet/tests/evmigration/`) |

```bash
# Clean any existing devnet, build from v1.11.1 binaries, and start
make devnet-new-1110
```

This runs `devnet-down` → `devnet-clean` → `devnet-build-1111` → (10s sleep) → `devnet-up`. The build uses `DEVNET_BUILD_LUMERA=0` (skips compiling lumerad, uses the pre-built binary from `devnet/bin-v1.11.1/`).

### Step 2: Prepare legacy state

Once the devnet is running on v1.11.1:

```bash
make devnet-evmigration-prepare
```

This creates legacy accounts and activity on each validator node. Accounts JSON files are written to `/shared/status/<moniker>/evmigration-accounts.json` inside the containers.

### Step 3: Upgrade to v1.20.0 (EVM)

```bash
make devnet-upgrade-1200
```

This calls `devnet/scripts/upgrade.sh v1.20.0 auto-height ../bin`, which:

1. **Submits a software-upgrade governance proposal** for`v1.20.0` at`current_height + 100`.
2. **Retrieves the proposal ID** and verifies it.
3. **Votes yes with all validators** (if in voting period).
4. **Waits for the chain to reach the upgrade height** (chain halts automatically).
5. **Swaps binaries**: stops containers, copies all files from`devnet/bin/` (the current build) to the shared release directory, restarts containers.

The `devnet/bin/` directory must contain the v1.20.0 `lumerad` binary (built by `make build`).

### Step 4: Check migration estimates

```bash
make devnet-evmigration-estimate
```

Verifies all legacy accounts are in the `ready_to_migrate` state.

### Step 5: Migrate regular accounts

```bash
make devnet-evmigration-migrate
```

Migrates all legacy (non-validator) accounts in randomized batches.

### Step 6: Migrate validators

```bash
make devnet-evmigration-migrate-validator
```

Migrates the validator operator account on each node with full post-migration validation.

### Step 7: Verify clean state

```bash
make devnet-evmigration-verify
```

Queries all modules via RPC to confirm no legacy address references remain (except legitimate `prev_supernode_accounts` entries). Exits non-zero if any leftover state is found.

### Step 8: Clean up

```bash
make devnet-evmigration-cleanup
```

Removes test keys from the keyring on each validator node.

## Rerun Support

All modes are **idempotent**:

- **prepare** — reloads`accounts.json` if it exists and skips already-created accounts.
- **estimate** — can be run any number of times; purely read-only.
- **migrate** — checks`migration-record` on-chain before submitting; skips already-migrated accounts and saves progress after each batch.
- **migrate-validator** — checks migration record before submitting.
- **verify** — purely read-only; can be run any number of times.
- **cleanup** — silently skips keys that don't exist.

## Runtime Version Checks

The tool validates the running `lumerad` version:

- **prepare** mode enforces`lumerad version < v1.20.0` (coin-type 118 environment).
- **estimate / migrate / migrate-validator** modes enforce`lumerad version >= v1.20.0` (coin-type 60 environment).
